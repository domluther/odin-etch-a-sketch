## Part 1 - Raw

- Create a container div to hold the 'pixels'
- Use a for loop to add the correct number of pixels to that container div
- Use CSS to wrap the pixels and make them a % of the container size
- Use a random RGB function to colour each pixel differently to prove that it works.

# Part 2 - Generation

- Add interactive feature - dragging over pixels
- Pen colours - black/rainbow/white
- Random generation - like a mosaic
- Reset image to clear it again
- Size restarting

# TODO

- Currently changes the pixel each time the mouse moves - how can I set it so it just does one per pixel? challenge - only one event listener not one per pixel
